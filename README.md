# Choose-Your-Adventure
Please dont copy it...




Choice Project Descriptions: 


1. Choose Your Own Adventure: 
The user's choices will guide the course of the Adventure. Think of an exciting video game, story or movie that helps you to envision the basic storyline for your adventure. For example, you are stuck in a haunted house and must find your way out. 


2. Recommendation Website: 
Ever wonder how Netflix decides what movies to recommend for you? Or how Amazon recommends books? We can get a feel for how it works by building a simplified recommender of our own! Write a program asking the user to answer questions that will in the end provide them with a recommendation that suits their interests. You can pick your own topic to recommend, and the questions you need to deduce what options to recommend. Please discuss your topic with me first, or choose from the following ideas: 
Travel Agency (Where should I go on vacation)
Clothes
Movies
Music
Books

All projects must include the following:
At least 6 decisions and 8 different conclusions
Conditional Statements (if, else if, else, etc.) implementing at least one logical operator (==, !=, >, <, etc. ). Also need to use || or && operators
At least one use of the modulo operator (%)
At least one use of a random number generator
At least one use of String comparison (equals or equalsIgnoreCase)
At least one use of a switch statement
DialogBoxes to retrieve all inputs




Though we will still be using breakout groups for this project, this is to be your own work. This project is to display the skills you have developed over the course of the year so far. Refer to the Student Handbook under “Academic Integrity” for additional information.















 




























This graphic organizer is only an example of the type of layout you can have. You can add or delete scenes to make it more suitable for your storyline/program.
